                    Gurdev Singh completed his BFA from College Of Art, (Delhi) in 2022 and is
                    currently pursuing his masterâ€™s at the Shiv Nadar University(2023-2025).His
                    artistic inspirations are deeply rooted in his faith and culture. Gurdev frequently
                    finds himself moved by the wonders and stories of Sikh pop culture, while also
                    attending to the themes of pride, tradition and the impact they have in his life.
                    Niche subculture identities, role of fashion, youth influences appear to him as a
                    means of expression and resistance to dominant cultural norms. Gurdev dabbles
                    in the a range of imagery from various sources; film stills, archives, found images
                    and photographs of evident events, in addition to the usual interchange of words
                    making his current bodies of work an eclectic freeze-frame of dynamic realities.
                    His artistic <br> approach includes cutting out of photographs, and extruding corny'
                    text from magazines while lending an expressive and gestural treatment to the
                    creation of images. He also compiles magazines with drawings which work on a
                    parallel narrative.

                My work traces varied profiles of the Sikh figure and how it has mutated and formulated
                over the time. My world within the Sikh world, with the Sikh position is a small one its
                nuanced,constantly shifting, moved by the pop, less relied on authority more on grassroots
                and always in a flux. With my response to the fancy Bollywood portrayals I stand with the
                Sikh kids in my school who had their heads covered in the Patka's who always felt as if
                they're misfit to the spiky haircuts,in other attempts I also touch upon the intra-community
                differences and inciting lyrics of Punjabi songs.
                To me images, lines, figures and photographs are never still they're always drifting.
                Even in my paintings and drawings everything is very active and there's no room for
                calmness to stay everything is very out and about
